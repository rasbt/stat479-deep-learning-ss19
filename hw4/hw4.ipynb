    "In this 4th homework, your task is to implement a convolutional neural network for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 color images with pixel dimensions 32x32. \n",
    "- There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images\n",
    "- Shown below is a snapshot showing a random selection for the 10 different object classes (from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "![](cifar-snapshot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The CIFAR-10 dataset is already made accessible via the PyTorch API as it is a common dataset for benchmarking image classifiers. Hence, you do not have to download the dataset manually -- it will be downloaded automatically when you call\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "train_dataset = datasets.CIFAR10(root='data', \n",
    "                                 train=True, \n",
    "                                 transform=transforms.ToTensor(),\n",
    "                                 download=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "in the provided code cells below for the first time. Thus, keep in mind that calling this function for the first time may be a bit slow depending on your internet connection. On a conventional internet connection, it should be downloaded in a matter of seconds, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are **not** using a separate validation dataset in this homework for tuning this network. This is intentional for the purposes of simplicity. However, in a real-world application, you are highly advised to use a validation dataset to tune the hyper parameters of the network as discussed in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Your main task is to implement a simple convolutional neural network that is loosely inspired by the AlexNet architecture that one the ImageNet competition in 2012: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). [Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. In Advances in neural information processing systems](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks) (pp. 1097-1105).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you will make several simple modifications to this network architecture to improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this homework, as explained above, you will NOT be working with ImageNet but CIFAR-10, which is a much smaller dataset, in order for you to be able to train the network in a timely manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, you will be asked to first implement a basic convolutional neural network based on AlexNet and then make several improvements to optimize the performance and reduce overfitting. These \"improvements\" include Dropout, BatchNorm, and image augmentation, which will serve as a good exercise for familiarizing yourself with \"Deep Learning Tricks\" as well as convolutional neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the homework is relatively easy and straightforward, but the training of the network in each of the 5 sections will take ~5 min to train on a GPU. On a CPU, it will probably be much longer. Because training on the CPU will take much longer, and because you probably don't want your computer to overheat, I **highly recommend running this homework on a cloud server**, for example, Google Colab (which allows you to use a GPU for free). Since you don't have to download the dataset manually, it should be relatively straightforward to do this homework on Google Colab and then download the solution for submission via Canvas. Please let me know if you have any questions about that. For a Cloud computing refresher, please see: https://github.com/rasbt/stat479-deep-learning-ss19/tree/master/L07_cloud-computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The due date for this homework is Friday, 11 April 11:59 pm.** Please start as soon as possible, because while this homework is conceptually straightforward, you have to factor in the computation time (~30 min runtime for the complete notebook if you run this notebook with correct solutions)."
